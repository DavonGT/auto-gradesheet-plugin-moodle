# Auto Gradesheet Plugin for Moodle

A Moodle local plugin that generates "Report of Grades" documents for Eastern Samar State University (ESSU), supporting on-screen preview, PDF export, and Excel export.

> **Thesis:** This plugin was developed as part of the undergraduate thesis *"Development of an Automated Grade Sheet Generation Plugin for the Moodle Learning Management System for Faculty Grade Reporting."*

## Features

- Role-based views (students see their own grade card; faculty/admins see all students)
- Weighted grade computation by category or midterm/finals fallback
- Philippine transmutation scale (1.0–5.0 equivalent ratings)
- Print-ready HTML preview with ESSU branding
- PDF export via TCPDF
- Excel export via PhpSpreadsheet
- Course-level configuration (semester, school year, signatories, grade categories)
- Auto-initialization of defaults on course creation
- Course edit form integration via the core course-form hooks (Moodle 4.4+; on 4.3 use the plugin's Settings page)

## Architecture

Business logic is centralized in the `classes/` layer:

- **`helper.php`** — Static methods for grade transmutation, config loading, student filtering, and per-student grade computation. Single source of truth for the grading formula.
- **`gradesheet_service.php`** — Coordinator that iterates all students and returns rows + pass/fail statistics. Used by `export.php`, `export_excel.php`, and `preview.php`.

Page files (`index.php`, `export.php`, `export_excel.php`, `preview.php`) are thin controllers responsible only for output formatting.

## Requirements

- Moodle 4.3 or later (`2023100900`); tested on 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 (Bootstrap 4 themes)
- PHP 8.0+ (whatever the Moodle release requires)
- PhpSpreadsheet (bundled with Moodle)
- TCPDF (bundled with Moodle)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository into `local/gradesheet/` within your Moodle installation:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gabrielkaos/auto-gradesheet-plugin-moodle.git local/gradesheet
   ```

2. In Moodle, go to **Site administration → Notifications**.

3. Complete the installation prompts.

## Usage

1. Open a Moodle course.
2. Navigate to the plugin page via the course navigation or admin menu.
3. Configure gradesheet settings (semester, school year, signatories, grade categories).
4. Preview the gradesheet.
5. Export as PDF or Excel.

## Sections (one grade sheet per section)

A Moodle **group** is a section. When a course has groups, the dashboard shows a section picker (regardless of the course's group-mode setting), an "All sections at a glance" table with Preview / PDF / Excel buttons per section, and **Download every section as PDF (ZIP)** (`export_all.php`). Each section's sheet has its own roster, section label, schedule and instructor line (Settings → Per-Section Overrides); grading categories, weights and the formula are shared by all sections of the course. Students who belong to no group are flagged because they appear on no section sheet. Under *Separate groups* mode, teachers only see their own sections and cannot open the combined sheet.

## Configuration

- Course-level settings: `course_settings.php` (all versions) or the Moodle course edit form (Moodle 4.4+ only; `\core_course\hook\after_form_definition` does not exist in 4.3, so on 4.3 the "Gradesheet Configuration" section simply does not appear in the course form — nothing else is affected).
- Signatory roles (`departmenthead`, `collegedean`, `registrar`) are created on install/upgrade; assign them at the category or system level for auto-detection.
- Default categories and config are auto-created on course creation.
- Language strings can be adjusted via `lang/en/local_gradesheet.php`.

## Security & Permissions

- `local/gradesheet:manage` — required for preview and exports (teachers, managers).
- `local/gradesheet:view` — required for viewing grades (students, teachers, managers).
- Capability checks and context validation are enforced on all entry points.
